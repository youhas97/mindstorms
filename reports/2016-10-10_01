Progress Report 1.

Group summary:
We have successfully completed all exercises up to twelve. We have built the robot following the given introductory instructions. We have done everything as a group so far and no individual work has been done. We spent the first lab building the robot and setting it up. The other labs have been spent on doing exercises where everyone participated equally.
