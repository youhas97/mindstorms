Noah:

Yohan: I have spent 8h on lab sessions, time has been spent on:
    -Completing milestone 21, which is printing the speed in the gui.
    -Completing milestone 23 with noah, we made the gui print the distance. I did tests on how fast it goes, later when we got the formula for the speed we used it in distance ( speed * time)
    -Trying to design our gui
    -Coming up with ideas for improvemets for giu, for instance, came up with ideas to bind keys and use it in combination with the rest of our gui in live state, and more.
    - Rehearsing Tkinter
