Progress report 6:

Group summary:
We have rebuilt the mounts for the sensors. The IR sensor does no longer detect
the floor within the 100 units. The color sensor is no longer too close or too far
away from the ground. With a more stable mount for the color sensor the follow tape
module is working more consistently. We have also added more functionality to our GUI.
We are now able to switch modes using the GUI by calling methods of the thread handler.
The GUI can function as usual while the unit runs (due to multithreading).
