Noah:
I have spent 10h on lab sessions and about an hour at home, totalling in 11h. My tim has been spent on:
-working on the surrender behaviour
-working on the follow tape class
-created a class that inherited FollowTape but followed the remote instead
-created a working thread class that handles the unit while the main thread handles the gui

and about two or three hours at home, though the hours at home may not be completely related to the mindstorms project. Time has been spent on:
-time spent at home was spent on fixing my working environment, which is now completely done!
-helping Noah a bit with ideas towards the follow tape class
-helping Noah on the surrender behaviour by giving ideas
