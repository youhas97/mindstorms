\section*{Group summary}
During the week we have started and finished milestones 1,2,3,4 and we are working on 5 and 6. Some of the time have been spent on rewriting old functions for the new robot in milestone 2 but the most time has been spent on playful/guard mode. We decided to build a new robot instead of the exersice bot. The robot has a finished design from LEGO so no time has been spent on designing it. Building it went pretty fast and took no more than 1 hour. We encountered a problem, when you interact with the robot to change mode you have to hold to button for quite some time because the playful/guard mode loop runs pretty slow, we have no solution so far.

\section*{Stig summary}
This week I started with rebuilding the robot while Sven and Anna looked at the milestones. After that I worked pretty stand alone from them and rewrote the functions to make the new robot move as the exersice bot.

\section*{Sven summary}
While Stig built the new robot I and Anna planned the future work and started on milestone 3 and 4 which we now are finished with. By using Subversion we can all work parallel and merge all code together which have worked very smooth.

\section*{Anna summary}
While Stig worked on the new robot I and Sven worked on milestone 3 and 4. That went pretty smooth and now we are working on Milestone 4 and 5. I had to leave earlier on Wednesday so I will work a couple of hours extra this Friday.
